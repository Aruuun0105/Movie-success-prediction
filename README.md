##  Dataset Note

Due to GitHubâ€™s 100MB file size limit, the full YouTube datasets (`USvideos.csv`, `INvideos.csv`) are not included in this repository.

 You can download the original dataset directly from Kaggle:  
 [YouTube Trending Video Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new)

Once downloaded, place the CSV files (`USvideos.csv`, `INvideos.csv`) in the same folder as the notebook and run the analysis end-to-end.
